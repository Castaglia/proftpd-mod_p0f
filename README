The mod_p0f module for ProFTPD uses the p0f utility for passively fingerprinting
clients which connect to the proftpd daemon.  The fingerprint data are
exposed for use via notes and environment variables.

For further module documentation, see mod_p0f.html.

Future Feature Ideas:

  P0FPolicy
    Configure the default allow/deny policy, for when no matching P0F*Filter
    is configured

  Properly handle proftpd restarts/SIGHUPs by stop/starting p0f process

  SFTP/SCP unit tests
